Recomended set instant replay to maximum (180 seconds).
Replay not corretly working offline.
Incident detection using mResultStream... not working together GTRtvPlugin (and another plugin using mResultStream). I have no idea how to resolve this.

Ini file created by first run UserData\player\rF2autocam.ini. Parameters default settings:
auto=1
autokey=0x41
waitsec=15
interest=12
interestdiff=3
onboarddiff=0.4
walkthrough=1
onboardcam=0
rearview=0
rearviewcam=6
camtest=no
showinpit=interestdiff
lowinc=0.4
highinc=0.8

Parameters:
- auto: auto camera change on/off on start (0->off, 1->on)
- waitsec: minimum wait between camera change (some randomization greater than this max +5sec)
- interest: top places with priority (default 12 -> 1-12 places higher priority)
- interestdiff: interesting gap (in seconds) if everyone out of this gap camera mode change to random mode
- onboarddiff: close gap (in sec) when gap is closest, 20% chance to change onboard
- autokey: auto mode on/off hotkey keykode (default 0x41-> ctrl+a)
- walkthrough:
 -- 0 -> off
 -- 1 -> camera "walk through" between cars on formation lap, and walk through first 3 when race finished and everyone finished.
- showinpit:
 -- never -> off
 -- always -> always show when anyone entering the pit
 -- interestdiff -> show when anyone entering the pit, when every gap out of interestdiff time
 -- onboarddiff -> show when anyone entering the pit, when every gap out of onboarddiff time 
 -- any number (integer) -> show always when the top <number> driver make pit stop
- onboardcam -> onboard camera type (number)
- rearview -> percent (0-100 integer only). Chance to change defenders rearview instead onboard
- rearviewcam -> rearview camera type (number)
- camtest: testing onboard or rearview camera
 -- no -> no testing. normal operation
 -- ob -> testing onboard camera. camera type always onboardcam
 -- rv -> testing rearview camera. camera type always rearviewcam
- lowinc -> 0.0-1.0 low incidents show in (replay) practices/quialifying everytime. Show race when everione out of close gap (out of onboarddiff).
- highinc -> 0.0-1.0 high indidents show everytime every session (replay)
 -- When lowinc and highinc parameters higher than 1.0, incident decetion off.
 -- Show incident with another vehicle or Immovable.
